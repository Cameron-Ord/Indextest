<h4>Games
<p> My favorite game is called Underrail. Its basically the spiritual successor to the original fallouts but better and made by indie serbian devs</p>
<h4>

<h4>My favoite shows
<p>Star Trek TNG and Star Trek DS9, I watched these in highschool and still come back to them occassionally.</p>
<p>I still love them to this day even with how cheesy they are. O'Brien really got the worst luck in the universe that man suffered so much</p>
